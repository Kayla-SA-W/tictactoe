# Application Title: Kayla W Tic Tac Toe

Two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

## Planning Story --->>>

I started off by creating a wireframe for what I wanted my page to look like. After drawing a few different
designs I settled on one to be the final outcome of my project.
After choosing a wireframe I walked myself through how to play tic tac toe and how you would win the game. I drew out a tic tac toe board and wrote out the possible winning combinations and created an array they housed them. After going over all of the properties and rules I wanted to have for my tic tac toe game I began to plan how I would want the game to work with javascript. I decided I wanted my game board to be represented by an array of blank strings that would be updated on a click. It would check who the current player was and make the corresponding spot with the correct player (based on if player one was true or false). Then it would run the check winner function which compared the current winner array to the current gameboard array. If there was a winner it would display the winner or if it was a tie, it would display the tie.


## User Stories --->>>
As a user, I want to be able to replay the game without refreshing the page so that is doesnt interrupt game flow
As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my score so that I know how many times i've won or lost
As a user, I want to visually see x's and o's on the board so its easy to what spaces are taken
As a user, I want to easily see if I've won or lost so that I understand the game is over
As a user , I want to be able to log in so that I can have all of my past games in one place
As a user, I want the same board to clear so there aren't multiple game boards on the screen

## Technologies Used --->>>
jQuery
HTML/CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript

## Unsolved Problems --->>>
Currently there is no score board and I would like to add one for the winner so that I can add a statistic for their highest score.
I would still like to refractor my code
I would still like to style my page
